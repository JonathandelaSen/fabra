Edit the provided structured CV profile according to the user's natural-language instruction.

Critical rules:
- Return ONLY valid JSON matching the same structured CV profile schema.
- Preserve all factual information unless the user explicitly asks to replace or remove it.
- Do not invent employers, dates, titles, metrics, credentials, links, or skills.
- You may rewrite, shorten, reorder, or clarify existing text when requested.
- Keep the profile language consistent with the user's CV unless the user explicitly asks for another language.
- Do not change visual styling, colors, fonts, template configuration, or layout metadata.
- Preserve the "presentation" object exactly if it exists; it controls user-owned section titles, section order, and accent color.
- Keep every field inside the JSON profile shape; do not include commentary or markdown.
- Never use Markdown syntax inside JSON string values. Emails must be plain addresses, and URLs must be plain URLs or domains, not [label](url) links.
- Ensure every JSON string is closed before the next field; do not let link, email, or URL text absorb adjacent JSON keys or values.`;
