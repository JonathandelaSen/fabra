## Supabase local auth email templates

When changing `supabase/config.toml` auth email template settings or any file in `supabase/templates/`, restart the local Supabase stack before asking the user to test. Use `npm run supabase:stop` followed by `npm run supabase:start`, then mention the local Mailpit URL from `supabase status`.

## Supabase production migrations

Never apply migrations or schema changes to the production Supabase project. Prepare and verify migration files locally, but leave production application to the user unless they explicitly instruct otherwise in the same turn.

## AI prompts and model controllers

Keep prompts and model-call logic/controllers in separate files. La lógica/controladores que llaman a modelos debe mantenerse en archivos separados de los prompts. Prompt builders/system instructions belong in prompt-only modules, and files that instantiate SDK clients or call model APIs must import those prompts instead of defining them inline. This reduces the risk that prompt edits break API integration code.

## AI prompt documentation

Every AI prompt family must have documentation under `docs/prompts/<prompt-type>/prompt.md`. The document must include the current prompt, the source file link/path, how it is fed with data, the runtime flow, and maintenance notes. When changing a prompt, prompt builder, model input data, response shape, or controller behavior that affects a prompt, actualizar la documentación del prompt en el mismo cambio.

## AI service dependency injection

AI model calls must follow the provider-aware factory pattern documented in `docs/architecture/ai-service-dependency-injection.md`.

- Use cases must depend on domain-layer AI service factory ports, not concrete Gemini/OpenAI/mock services.
- AI service factory `create(...)` contracts must include an explicit `provider`, a required `model`, and an `apiKey` that is required for real providers and optional for `mock`.
- Module composition roots (`*.module.ts`) must inject provider-aware factories, not provider-specific factories such as `Gemini*AIServiceFactory`.
- Provider-aware factories live in infrastructure, receive provider-specific factories by constructor injection, call `assertAIProviderAllowedForRuntime(provider)`, and then delegate to the matching provider-specific factory.
- In automated tests, only `provider: "mock"` is allowed. Requesting any real provider must throw. In production, `provider: "mock"` must throw. In development, both mock and real providers are allowed.
- Official mock AI implementations should be deterministic, clearly marked as mock output, and usable for local/dev/test flows without real AI API calls.
- Frontend and API contracts must use provider-agnostic names: `provider`, `apiKey`, and `model`. Do not introduce or preserve new `geminiApiKey` fallbacks when migrating AI routes.
- Observability for AI-backed backend actions must include `provider` and `model` metadata.

## Assisted workflows

The app is AI driven but not AI restricted. AI-backed product actions should follow the assisted workflow model documented in `docs/architecture/assisted-workflows.md`.

- Classify each AI-backed action by supported assistance modes: `manual`, `copy_paste`, and `integrated`.
- `copy_paste` is an interaction mode, not an AI provider. It uses `prepare`, `preview`, and `apply` steps so users can run prompts in an external chat and paste the response back into the app.
- `integrated` mode uses model providers such as `ollama`, `api_key`, `app_subscription`, or `mock`.
- When an action cannot support `manual`, document the reason explicitly.
- Structured Copy Paste responses must use the standard JSON envelope with `workflowId`, `schemaVersion`, and `result`.

## Git main branch

Never push to `main`. Commit locally or push to a non-main branch if requested, but leave `main` pushes to the user unless they explicitly instruct otherwise in the same turn.

## Worktrees

Work directly on `main` (the primary checkout) by default. Do not create git worktrees or switch to alternate branches unless the user explicitly asks for it in the same turn. If worktrees were created in earlier turns, clean them up and continue on `main`.

Do not add [extensions] worktreeConfig = true" to .git/config because it breaks antigravity IDE

## shadcn/ui

We will use shadcn/ui whenever there is a useful component in the library. We will not reinvent the wheel and will prefer existing shadcn components over creating custom UI components from scratch.

## Observability

Observability is handled exclusively through Sentry (see `docs/architecture/technical-observability.md`). The legacy internal `EventTracker` / `processing_events` product-observability system and its `/admin/observability` UI have been removed. Do not reintroduce a `recordProcessingEvent`-style tracker; rely on Sentry technical telemetry instead.

## Hexagonal architecture (DDD modules)

The backend is being migrated progressively from `src/lib/db.ts` to hexagonal architecture under `src/backend/modules/`. **Work Journal** is the first migrated module and serves as the reference pattern for future modules.

### Module structure

```
src/backend/modules/

    index.ts                           ← Barrel file exporting public API
```

### Key conventions

- **Domain uses camelCase**. `snake_case` belongs to database rows and legacy HTTP payloads only. New internal API response contracts should be camelCase; infrastructure repositories and route presenters map between DB/API shapes and domain primitives.
- **Entities are aggregate roots**: classes extending `AggregateRoot`, built from ValueObjects, with an ID, `static create(params)`, `static fromPrimitives(primitives)`, `toPrimitives()`, private/protected constructors, and domain methods that record domain events internally.
- **Value objects are immutable**: one `*.value-object.ts` file per VO, `static fromPrimitives(...)`, `toPrimitives()`, private/protected state, no mutating methods. Shared concerns such as IDs, ISO dates, optional ISO dates, timestamps, and user IDs live under `src/backend/modules/shared/domain/value-objects/`.
- **Primitives are boundary data**: `EntityPrimitives` interfaces live with the entity and use camelCase. Only `fromPrimitives` and `toPrimitives` convert between VOs and primitives. Do not pass primitives into entity constructors or domain methods.
- **Repositories work with aggregates and VOs**: aggregate repositories expose `search(criteria)`, `findById(id VO, userId VO)`, `save(aggregate)`, and `delete(id VO, userId VO)`. They must not accept or return `*Primitives`, `Create*Input`, `Update*Input`, or primitive entity fields. Infrastructure repositories map DB `snake_case` rows to domain camelCase primitives and hydrate aggregates.
- **Associations use IDs in the domain**. Do not nest aggregate instances inside other aggregates. Compose read models for UI/API responses in the application/route boundary.
- **Domain events are internal for now**. Aggregate methods record events with `recordDomainEvent`; use cases may call `pullDomainEvents()` later. Technical observability is handled by Sentry, not by a domain-level tracker.
- **Use cases** receive dependencies via constructor injection (`{ repo, tracker, ... }`).
- **Modules are singletons** constructed once at import time — not rebuilt per request. The app container (`src/lib/container.ts`) is the composition root that wires up all modules, query buses, and query handler registrations. Route handlers import modules from the container.
- **Infrastructure repositories implement `SupabaseAware`** (`src/backend/modules/shared/infrastructure/supabase-aware.ts`). They have no constructor parameters. Instead they expose a `bindRequest(client: SupabaseClient)` method that sets the Supabase client for the current request. The module's own `bindRequest` method delegates to all its repositories. Route handlers call `myModule.bindRequest(supabase)` once per request before calling any use case. **Reference implementation:** `job-analysis-chat` module.
- **Route handlers** import the module singleton from `src/lib/container.ts`, call `module.bindRequest(supabase)`, and then call use case `.execute()`. HTTP validation (`normalize*` functions) stays in the route handlers.
- **Domain errors** are caught by `handleDomainError()` which maps them to HTTP status codes.
- **AI prompts and controllers live inside their module** under `infrastructure/services/`. Prompt builders go in a `*-prompts.ts` file, and the SDK client call goes in a separate `gemini-*-ai.service.ts` file. Both files are colocated in the same directory. **Reference:** `feedback-notes` module.
- **Cross-module data access uses the query bus**. A use case that needs data from another module must dispatch a query through the `QueryBus` (injected via constructor), never import another module's repository or use case directly. Query classes and handlers live under `application/queries/` in the owning module and are registered in `container.ts`.
- **Cross-module port interfaces** provide minimal contracts (e.g., `CVDataRepository` exposes only what the consuming module needs) when shared infrastructure is unavoidable.
- **`getAuthedSupabase()`** and `validation.ts` helpers stay in the route handler layer, not in the module.

### API controllers, helpers, and CQRS boundaries

- Avoid business-logic helpers under `src/app/api/**`. API-layer helpers should be limited to HTTP concerns such as auth wrappers, request parsing, validation normalization, response mapping, or thin infrastructure adapters that genuinely belong to the API layer.
- API controllers may orchestrate multiple module use cases/commands when the flow requires it. This orchestration is acceptable, but the business decisions and side effects must live inside module use cases, not in controller helper functions.
- Queries must be side-effect free. A query must not persist data, upload/delete files, retry extraction, record business workflow actions, or trigger commands.
- Queries must not execute commands. If a flow needs to read state and then perform an action, orchestrate that explicitly from the API controller or from a command/use case designed for that workflow.
- Prefer explicit idempotent commands for “ensure/retry/prepare” behavior. For example, a flow like “return existing CV extraction if present, otherwise download the CV, extract text, persist it, and return the result” should be modeled as a command/use case, not as a query or API helper.
- Push business workflow logic into modules. Rendering a template CV for analysis, extracting text, choosing the best extracted text, persisting extraction results, producing extraction diagnostics, and recording observability for backend actions belong in module application/infrastructure services, not in `src/app/api` helpers.
- Avoid vague shared helper names for business workflows. Use names that express the use case, such as `EnsureCVDocumentExtractionUseCase` or `PrepareAnalysisInputUseCase`, rather than generic helpers like `create-analysis-input`.

### API controller anatomy

Every route handler in `src/app/api/**` must follow this exact structure. There are no exceptions.

#### 1. Auth + Supabase client — always via `getAuthenticatedRequestContext()`

Use `getAuthenticatedRequestContext()` from `@/app/api/_shared/auth/request-context` as the very first step inside the `try` block. It creates the per-request Supabase client **and** verifies the session in one call, returning a discriminated union:

```ts
const authContext = await getAuthenticatedRequestContext();
if (!authContext.ok) return authContext.response; // 401 already serialized
const { supabase, user } = authContext;
```

- **Never** call `createClient()` directly inside a route handler — always go through `getAuthenticatedRequestContext()`.
- **Never** call `supabase.auth.getUser()` manually in a route handler.
- Extract `supabase` and `user` immediately after the guard.

#### 2. Bind the Supabase client to the module

After obtaining `supabase`, bind it to every module you'll use in this request **before** calling any use case:

```ts
myModule.bindRequest(supabase);
```

Call `bindRequest` once per module per request, right before the first use-case call. If the handler orchestrates multiple modules, bind all of them.

#### 3. Validate the request payload — always before `bindRequest`

Parse and validate query params or body **before** binding and executing use cases. Use a dedicated `parse*` function from the route-local `validation.ts` file. These functions return `{ ok: true, value }` or `{ ok: false, error: { message, status } }`:

```ts
const parsed = parseCreateFeedbackRequest(body);
if (!parsed.ok) {
  return errorResponse(parsed.error); // 400 with error message
}
```

`errorResponse` is imported from `@/backend/modules/shared`.

#### 4. Error handling — always `handleApiError` in the `catch`

Wrap the entire handler body in `try/catch` and delegate all error handling to `handleApiError`:

```ts
} catch (error: unknown) {
  return handleApiError(error);
}
```

`handleApiError` (from `@/backend/modules/shared`) handles:

- `HttpError` (thrown by `notFound()`, `badRequest()`, `forbidden()`, `conflict()`) → proper 4xx status.
- `DomainError` subclasses → 404 for `*NotFoundError`, 400 otherwise.
- Anything else → 500 with console error log.

Do **not** use the legacy `handleDomainError()` from `domain-error-handler.ts` in new route handlers — it uses string-matching on error names and is not maintained. Use `handleApiError` exclusively.

#### 5. Response helpers

Use the response helpers from `@/backend/modules/shared` — never construct `NextResponse` manually:

| Helper                 | Status     | Use for                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ok(data)`             | 200        | Successful reads                                         |
| `created(data)`        | 201        | Successful creates                                       |
| `errorResponse(error)` | variable   | Validation failures (from `parse*`)                      |
| `notFound(msg)`        | throws 404 | Resource not found (throw inside use case or controller) |
| `badRequest(msg)`      | throws 400 | Invalid state detected in controller                     |
| `forbidden(msg)`       | throws 403 | Authorization failure beyond auth check                  |
| `conflict(msg)`        | throws 409 | Conflicting resource state                               |

#### Complete canonical example

```ts
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { getAuthenticatedRequestContext } from "@/app/api/_shared/auth/request-context";
import { myModule } from "@/lib/container";
import { presentMyEntity } from "@/backend/modules/my-module";
import { ok, created, errorResponse, handleApiError } from "@/backend/modules/shared";
import { parseCreateMyEntityRequest } from "./validation";

export async function GET() {
  try {
    const authContext = await getAuthenticatedRequestContext();
    if (!authContext.ok) return authContext.response;
    const { supabase, user } = authContext;

    myModule.bindRequest(supabase);
    const entities = await myModule.listEntities.execute(user.id);
    return ok(entities.map(presentMyEntity));
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    return handleApiError(error);
  }
}

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const authContext = await getAuthenticatedRequestContext();
    if (!authContext.ok) return authContext.response;
    const { supabase, user } = authContext;

    const body = await req.json();
    const parsed = parseCreateMyEntityRequest(body);
    if (!parsed.ok) return errorResponse(parsed.error);

    myModule.bindRequest(supabase);
    const entity = await myModule.createEntity.execute({
      userId: user.id,
      ...parsed.value,
    });
    return created(presentMyEntity(entity));
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    return handleApiError(error);
  }
}
```

### When adding features to a migrated module

1. Add the domain type/error if needed.
2. Extend the repository interface if the use case needs new data access.
3. Implement the repository method in the Supabase infrastructure class (must implement `SupabaseAware` with `bindRequest`).
4. Create a new use case class.
5. Wire it in the module factory (`<module>.module.ts`).
6. If a new repository was added, include it in the module's `bindRequest` method.
7. Call it from the route handler via `jobAnalysisChatModule.<useCase>.execute(...)` (importing from `src/lib/container.ts`).

### When migrating a new module

Follow the `job-analysis-chat` module as the reference pattern for the singleton/`bindRequest` architecture. Steps:

1. Create domain layer (entities, VOs, errors, repository ports).
2. Create infrastructure repositories implementing both the domain port and `SupabaseAware`. Constructors take no parameters; the Supabase client is received via `bindRequest`.
3. Create use cases with constructor injection of repository singletons.
4. Create the module factory (`<module>.module.ts`): instantiate repos and use cases at module level; export a `create<Module>Module()` function that returns use cases plus a `bindRequest` method that delegates to all repositories.
5. Register the module in `src/lib/container.ts` — this is the only place where modules are instantiated.
6. Switchover route handlers: import from `src/lib/container.ts`, call `module.bindRequest(supabase)` per request.
7. Clean up `db.ts` functions only after routes no longer use them.

Each step should be a separate commit.

### Testing conventions

- **Domain layer:** Aggregate roots and value objects must have colocated tests. Test `create`, `fromPrimitives`, `toPrimitives`, validation, domain methods, and recorded events. Domain services with logic also need colocated tests.
- **Infrastructure layer:** Backend tests (`*.test.ts`) against real Supabase E2E stack (ports 56431+). Test each repository method. One test user per test via `createConfirmedUser()`. Repositories are instantiated without arguments and configured with `repo.bindRequest(supabase)` before use.
- **Application layer:** Backend tests with real repositories against real DB. Mock only external services (AI) and cross-cutting concerns. Test happy paths, domain error cases, and orchestration logic.
- **No mocks for database** — all DB interactions use the real Supabase E2E instance.
- **Never test AI services directly** — AI service implementations must not be exercised in automated tests. Use mocks injected into use cases whenever AI behavior is required.
- Run with `npm run test:backend` (auto-starts Supabase E2E stack if not running).
- Test files live next to the code they test and share the source filename plus `.test.ts`: `create-context.use-case.ts` → `create-context.use-case.test.ts`, `supabase-work-journal-entry.repository.ts` → `supabase-work-journal-entry.repository.test.ts`.
- Run `npm run ddd:check` before finishing changes under `src/backend/modules/`. It runs:
  - `scripts/verify-ddd-tests.mjs`: every `src/backend/modules/**/application/use-cases/*.use-case.ts` and every `src/backend/modules/**/infrastructure/repositories/*.repository.ts` must have a colocated `*.test.ts` file with the same basename.
  - `scripts/verify-ddd-imports.mjs`: module internals must respect DDD import direction. Domain cannot import application or infrastructure, application cannot import infrastructure, infrastructure cannot import application, and feature modules cannot import another feature module's internal paths. Barrel imports (`@/backend/modules/<name>`) across modules are allowed for cross-module query dispatch via QueryBus. Composition roots (`<module>.module.ts`), module barrels, tests, test helpers, external packages, and `src/backend/modules/shared/**` are allowed where appropriate.
  - `scripts/verify-ddd-entities.mjs`: modules listed in `migratedModules` must follow the AggregateRoot/ValueObject/repository rules above.
  - `scripts/verify-ddd-value-objects.mjs`: every `src/backend/modules/**/domain/value-objects/*.value-object.ts` (all modules) must export a class extending `ValueObject` (or a shared base VO), with a private/protected constructor, `static fromPrimitives(...)`, `toPrimitives()`, no mutator methods, and no public mutable properties. Additionally, `*Primitives` boundary interfaces must use plain primitives — a field typed as a VO union alias or domain type (e.g. `EvidenceSourceValue`, `ContextType`, `Date`) is rejected; widen it to its primitive (e.g. `string`) and let `fromPrimitives` narrow/validate. See the patterns in `docs/architecture/value-objects.md`.
  - `scripts/verify-ddd-route-imports.mjs`: files under `src/app/`, `src/frontend/components/`, and `src/lib/` that import from `@/backend/modules/<name>` must use the barrel (`@/backend/modules/<name>` or `@/backend/modules/<name>/index`), never reach into internal paths like `@/backend/modules/<name>/infrastructure/...`. `@/backend/modules/shared` is exempt.
  - `scripts/verify-ddd-barrel-exports.mjs`: module barrel files (`index.ts`) must not re-export from `infrastructure/` or from `domain/repositories/`. Infrastructure details must be accessed through use cases, and repository port interfaces are module-internal (consumers use them via relative/alias imports within the same module). `@/backend/modules/shared` is exempt.

### Re-export shims in `src/lib/`

Some `src/lib/` files are thin re-export shims that bridge old import paths to domain files inside modules (e.g., `src/lib/cv-profile.ts` → `@/backend/modules/cv-library/domain/cv-profile`). These shims **must import from the domain file directly**, not from the module barrel (`@/backend/modules/<name>`), because the barrel re-exports the full module (use cases, repositories, etc.) and Next.js Turbopack does not tree-shake barrel re-exports in client components — importing the barrel from a client component drags in `server-only` code and breaks the build. These shim files are listed in the `reExportShims` set in `scripts/verify-ddd-route-imports.mjs` so they are exempt from the barrel-only rule.

## Frontend feature architecture

The frontend is moving from component-only module folders to route-driven feature folders. New substantial frontend work should use `src/frontend/features/<feature-name>/` instead of adding more business logic under `src/frontend/components/<module-name>/`.

`src/` is organized by layer:

```
src/
  app/                  ← Next.js routes + API handlers (Next.js convention, untouched)
  backend/
    modules/            ← hexagonal DDD modules
  frontend/             ← all client-side code
    features/<feature-name>/
      api/              ← frontend HTTP client and query keys for the feature
      hooks/            ← route state, TanStack Query hooks, mutation orchestration
      components/       ← feature-specific React components
      index.ts          ← public feature barrel
    components/         ← cross-feature UI
      shell/            ← global app chrome
      shared/           ← cross-feature reusable UI components
      ui/               ← generic UI primitives, prefer shadcn/ui
    i18n/               ← translation messages and next-intl config
    utils/              ← cross-feature client infra (api/, errors/, helpers)
    testing/            ← shared test setup, render helpers, msw
  shared/               ← contracts/constants shared between backend and frontend
  lib/                  ← cross-cutting utilities and infra (supabase, pdf, container)
  types/                ← global type declarations
```

### Conventions

1. New feature UI, feature-specific hooks, and feature-specific API clients go in `src/frontend/features/<feature-name>/`.
2. `src/frontend/components/<module-name>/` is legacy for existing screens. Do not add new business-heavy screens there unless the file is only a temporary migration shim.
3. Cross-feature reusable UI components go in `src/frontend/components/shared/`.
4. Generic UI primitives go in `src/frontend/components/ui/` and should prefer shadcn/ui.
5. Feature internals are private by default. A feature may be imported by other code only through its `index.ts` public barrel.
6. Do not deep-import from another feature. If a hook/API/type is needed by multiple features, either intentionally export it from the owning feature barrel or move it to `src/frontend/utils/` once a second real consumer exists.
7. Do not move code to shared speculatively. Shared frontend code should be extracted only after reuse is real or dependency direction would otherwise be wrong.

### Frontend component composition

Do not leave large feature screens as one monolithic component. Route/view components in `src/frontend/features/<feature>/components/*-view.tsx` should orchestrate data, route state, mutations, and top-level local UI state, while substantial UI regions live in **separate sibling files** in the same `components/` directory. Split obvious sections such as sidebars, detail headers, forms, lists, list rows, inline editors, modals, and repeated panels into their own `*.tsx` file before finishing the change. As a rule of thumb, once a view component grows beyond roughly 250-300 lines or contains multiple independent UI regions, extract components into separate files in the same feature folder instead of waiting for a follow-up review.

Do not use JSX comments to label regions that should be components, such as `{/* Header */}`, `{/* Sidebar */}`, `{/* Tabs */}`, `{/* Panel Body */}`, or `{/* Footer Actions */}`. When a block needs that kind of label to be understandable, extract the block into a clearly named component in a separate sibling file and render that component instead. For example, prefer `ObjectiveFormHeader`, `OfferChatSidebar`, or `ExtractionParserTabs` over keeping a commented block inline.

### Component folder organization within a feature

`src/frontend/features/<feature>/components/` organizes its files by **functional region of the product**, not by render hierarchy. The goal is that a folder name tells you which part of the feature a component belongs to (kanban, detail, chat, new-flow), and that the folder stays stable across refactors.

**Threshold — do not reorganize small features.** A feature with roughly **fewer than 15 components** keeps a single flat `components/` directory. Most features are this size and must not grow speculative subfolders. Only once a feature crosses ~15 components, or clearly contains multiple independent UI regions, introduce region subfolders.

**Rules when subfoldering:**

1. **Group by functional region, never by render depth.** Do not create a folder for "the view's direct children" vs "the rest" — membership in such a folder is an implementation detail that churns on every refactor and says nothing about what a component does. Use stable domain regions instead: `kanban/`, `list/`, `detail/`, `new-flow/`, `extraction/`, `copy-paste/`, etc.
2. **The orchestration spine stays at the root of `components/`.** That is the entry `*-view.tsx`, its `*-skeleton.tsx`, and the thin orchestrators whose only job is to compose regions together (e.g. a `*-body` that switches between list and kanban, or a `*-main-panel` that switches between detail / extraction / pending). Everything that belongs to a single region moves into that region's folder.
3. **Co-locate by cohesion.** A component goes in the folder of the region that owns it. A component used by only one region lives inside that region (e.g. score/status badges used only by the list row live in `list/`). Nest one extra level only when a region is itself large and has clear sub-areas (e.g. `detail/tabs/`, `detail/chat/`).
4. **Name folders after the domain region**, as a short noun (`kanban`, `detail`, `new-flow`). Never use catch-all names like `parts/`, `misc/`, `shared/`, or `common/`.
5. **Folder structure is feature-internal.** Features remain private behind their `index.ts` barrel; no DDD/boundary check inspects the internal shape of `components/`, so regions can be introduced per feature as they grow. The barrel and any test `vi.mock(...)` paths must be updated when files move.

**Reference implementation:** `src/frontend/features/job-match-analysis/components/` (root orchestration spine + `list/`, `kanban/`, `new-flow/`, `extraction/`, `detail/` with `detail/tabs/` and `detail/chat/`, and `copy-paste/`).

### Internationalization (i18n)

All user-visible strings in React components must use `next-intl` translations via `useTranslations()`. Never hardcode UI strings (labels, descriptions, placeholders, error messages, microcopy) directly in components. Add translation keys to `src/frontend/i18n/messages.ts` under both the `en` and `es` sections. Use a feature-scoped namespace key (e.g., `activityContexts`, `feedbackNotes`) and call `const t = useTranslations("featureNamespace")` in each component. Existing features that already use translations serve as reference.

### Code style: no decorative comments

Do not use decorative or separator comments such as `/* ─────── section ─────── */`, `{/* Name + meta */}`, or similar ASCII art dividers. Use blank lines and clear naming to organize code. Inline JSX comments explaining what an obvious element does (e.g., `{/* Error */}`, `{/* Header */}`) are also unnecessary and should be omitted.

### Frontend API and response contracts

Every API route that is consumed by frontend code should expose an explicit response contract in a colocated `responses.ts` file:

```
src/app/api/<route>/route.ts
src/app/api/<route>/responses.ts
```

Rules:

1. `responses.ts` belongs to the HTTP layer because it describes the exact serialized route response.
2. `responses.ts` may compose presenter output types from one or more modules.
3. `responses.ts` may contain pure response builders when a route aggregates data or transforms shape. For trivial responses, prefer response types plus `satisfies` in `route.ts`.
4. New response contracts should be camelCase. Legacy snake_case responses may be migrated progressively.
5. Frontend code must never import from `route.ts`.
6. Frontend API clients may import response types from `responses.ts`, preferably with `import type`.
7. `responses.ts` must be frontend-import-safe: no `NextRequest`, `NextResponse`, `server-only`, Supabase imports, module container imports, auth request context imports, route runtime logic, or infrastructure imports.

Allowed frontend data flow:

```
src/backend/modules/<module>/application presenters
        ↓
src/app/api/**/responses.ts
        ↓
src/frontend/features/<feature>/api/*-api.ts
        ↓
src/frontend/features/<feature>/hooks/*
        ↓
src/frontend/features/<feature>/components/*
```

Frontend files under `src/frontend/features/**`, `src/frontend/components/**`, and `src/frontend/**` must not import from `src/backend/modules/**` or `@/backend/modules/**`. Module types and presenters are consumed by API routes/responses, not by React components or frontend hooks.

### TanStack Query and frontend state

TanStack Query is the standard owner for server state in migrated frontend features. Use it for data loaded from the backend, mutation state, invalidation, refetching, and optimistic updates.

All frontend mutations in migrated features should use optimistic updates by default. Update the affected TanStack Query cache in `onMutate`, cancel in-flight queries for that cache key, roll back from the saved previous value in `onError`, and reconcile the optimistic entity with the server response in `onSuccess`. Do not refetch broad list/workspace endpoints after routine create/update/delete mutations unless the mutation response cannot provide enough data to keep the cache correct or the workflow intentionally needs server recomputation.

Mutation hooks must live in `src/frontend/features/<feature>/hooks/` and encapsulate `useMutation()` calls with their `mutationFn`, `onSuccess` invalidation, and any orchestration logic. View components must not call `mutations.create.mutateAsync(...)` directly — instead, they should call purpose-named hook callbacks (e.g., `useCreateActivityContext()`, `usePromoteSuggestion()`) that internally handle the mutation, error state, and cache invalidation. This keeps view components thin and mutation logic testable and reusable.

Do not copy `useQuery().data` into `useState` unless it is intentionally becoming an editable local draft.

Use React local state for UI-only state:

- form drafts and textarea contents
- current inline edit id
- modal open/closed state
- copied indicators
- purely local visual state

Do not create view models that are 1:1 copies of API response types. Prefer frontend-friendly camelCase response contracts, derived aliases such as `Response[number]`, and mappers only when the UI needs a genuinely different shape.

### Build verification

After any change under `src/backend/modules/`, `src/lib/`, `src/app/`, `src/frontend/components/`, `src/frontend/features/`, or `src/frontend/`, run `npm run build` before finishing. Type-checking alone (`tsc --noEmit`) does not catch Next.js server/client boundary errors — only the full build does.

### Agent check

After touching code, always run `npm run agent:check` before handing work back. This is the standard guard command for agents and contributors: it runs the code-related architecture checks and the production build with compact success output. If a check fails, the command prints the failing script output and exits non-zero.

### Architecture verification

Frontend boundary checks should be automated alongside the existing DDD checks. The verification should reject:

- frontend imports from `src/backend/modules/**` or `@/backend/modules/**`
- frontend imports from `src/app/api/**/route` or `@/app/api/**/route`
- cross-feature deep imports that bypass a feature `index.ts`
- `responses.ts` files importing Next runtime, `server-only`, Supabase, `@/lib/container`, auth request context, or module infrastructure

## Agent Workflow Preferences

- **Commits:** Do not make commits automatically. Always leave any changes uncommitted so the user can review them manually before committing.

## Agent Test User

Use the following credentials when a test user is required for automated or manual agent actions:

- **Email:** `agent-test@example.com`
- **Password:** `agent-test-password`

To seed the local database with a complete set of mock entities specifically for this user (CVs, Analyses, Opportunities, Work Journal, Feedback Notes, Objectives, etc.), run the following command:

```bash
npm run supabase:seed-agent
# Or with custom credentials:
npm run supabase:seed-agent -- --email custom@example.com --password mypass
```

Running this command is completely idempotent: it automatically finds or creates the user and cleans up any existing mock records under their ID before inserting a fresh set of synthetic mock data.

## Avoid Real AI API Usage

Do **not** use the real AI provider API keys to perform actual AI analysis during tasks, in order to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. Use mocks, stubs, or bypass the actual AI call if you need to test the workflow.
