## Current Prompt
```text
You are a strict ATS recruiter and job-posting analyst. Compare the extracted text from a PDF resume against a specific job posting.

The job description is:
---
{job_description}
---

The source URL provided by the user is: {job_url}

Return the comparison and the job-posting summary as structured data. If a field is not present in the job posting, use null or an empty array. Do not invent salary, holidays, company, or benefits.

You must respond ONLY with valid JSON using this exact format:
{
  "score": <number from 0 to 100, where 100 means perfect match>,
  "feedback": "<Detailed analysis in Spanish of how well the resume matches the job posting. Highlight strongest matches and biggest gaps.>",
  "keywordsFound": ["<keyword from job description found in resume>", ...],
  "jobKeywords": ["<important keyword or requirement from the job posting>", ...],
  "cvKeywords": ["<relevant keyword or skill found in the CV>", ...],
  "matchingKeywords": ["<keyword present in both job posting and CV>", ...],
  "missingKeywords": ["<important job keyword missing from the CV>", ...],
  "improvements": ["<specific change to better match this job posting, in Spanish>", ...],
  "jobKeyData": {
    "title": "<job title or null>",
    "company": "<company name or null>",
    "location": "<location or null>",
    "remote": "<remote/hybrid/onsite signal or null>",
    "salary": "<salary/compensation if explicit or null>",
    "seniority": "<seniority if explicit or inferable from requirements, or null>",
    "contractType": "<contract type if explicit or null>",
    "benefits": ["<benefit, vacation, perk, or empty>", ...],
    "requirements": ["<key requirement>", ...],
    "responsibilities": ["<key responsibility>", ...],
    "notablePoints": ["<brief relevant point, condition, warning, or differentiator>", ...]
  }
}
```

If `job_url` is empty, the URL block is omitted.

## Data Inputs
- User content sent to the model: extracted CV text from the selected analysis.
- System instruction data: `job_description` and optional `job_url`.
- Output parser: `parseAIResult`, including `jobKeyData`, `jobKeywords`, `matchingKeywords`, and `missingKeywords`.

## Runtime Flow
1. `POST /api/job-match-analyses/[id]/score` validates the authenticated request and scoring payload.
2. `ScoreJobMatchAnalysisUseCase` loads the job-match analysis owned by the current user.
3. `GeminiJobMatchScoringAIService` builds this prompt with `buildJobMatchScoringPrompt` and sends the extracted CV text as the user message.
4. The result is persisted on `job_match_analyses` and later powers offer tabs, tracking, interview questions, and offer chat.

## Copy Paste Workflow

### Envelope
```json
{
  "workflowId": "job_match_analysis.score",
  "schemaVersion": "1",
  "result": { ... same fields as integrated result, using aiKeywords instead of keywordsFound ... }
}
```

### Copy Paste Prompt
`buildJobMatchScoringCopyPastePrompt` reuses the integrated system prompt from `buildJobMatchScoringPrompt` and appends:
- JSON-only transport instructions
- Envelope shape with `workflowId` and `schemaVersion`
- Expected `result` schema
- The extracted CV text

### Copy Paste Runtime Flow
1. `prepare`: Loads analysis, extracts CV text, builds copy-paste prompt, returns prompt + privacy notice.
2. User copies prompt to external chat, runs it, gets JSON response.
3. `preview`: Parses JSON, validates envelope and result schema, returns preview summary + parsed result.
4. `apply`: Revalidates parsed result, persists with `aiModel: "external-chat"`, records observability with `assistanceMode: "copy_paste"`.

### Data Included in Copy Paste Prompt
- Extracted CV text (fallback: textPython > textPdfjs > textNode)
- Job description
- Job URL (if provided)

### Privacy
Non-blocking warning: "This prompt may include CV data and context you entered."

### Validation
- Strict JSON envelope: exact `workflowId` and `schemaVersion`
- Score: number 0-100
- Feedback: non-empty string
- Array fields: arrays of strings
- jobKeyData: object or null
- Extra fields are preserved

## Maintenance
When `buildJobMatchScoringPrompt`, `buildJobMatchScoringCopyPastePrompt`, their output JSON shapes, or the offer fields sent to the model change, update this document in the same change. Integrated and Copy Paste prompt semantics must stay aligned.
